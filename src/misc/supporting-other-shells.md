# Supporting other shells

As of now, this project only supports `zsh` but adding bash support should be relatively easy.

1. [Add support for different profile types](https://github.com/catc/c/blob/master/scripts/init.sh#L26)
2. [Add support for different shells](https://github.com/catc/c/blob/master/scripts/init.sh#L130)
3. [Ensure that the completion keywords support your shell](https://github.com/catc/c/blob/master/src/autocomplete.ts#L5-L12)
